Google Chrome's Super Drag is my personal side project since September 2017.

## Why I create it?

I've developed web browser based on Chromium since 2011 and the most popular features are **Super Drag** and **Mouse Gesture**. They were all developed with C++.

Although our product has more than 200 thousands DAU all over the world, it's hard to say we are success especially facing with Google Chrome.

After the whole team was bought by Tencent, it's the end of the game I know.

I tried my best to make the core features to live on event without modification from the browser lower layer just only using the APIs exposed with `chrome` extension.

`Super Drag` is the lucky one

## TODOs

- [ ] Support drag-n-drop text easily
- [x] Support drag-n-drop with different directions using dedicated search engine to search
